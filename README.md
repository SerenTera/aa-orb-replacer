# aa-orb-replacer
(Untested) Attempt to replace the orbs in Antaros abyss with better sphere shape

READ ====>>>>> UNTESTED MODULE, USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION <<<<==== READ

Light orb replaced with straw football (already tried an energy orb, unfortunately an invisible npc shape Id)

Dark orb replaced with stone orb from timescape

If anyone has any suggestions for better replacements, feel free to do so~

## Config
`switchColors` - Default false. True reverses the replacement, where light orb is replaced with stone orb from timescape and vice versa, thus, with black aura debuff, you hit the black orb instead.

`instantDespawn` - Leave this to true or else it will stay around for longer than necessary

## Commands:
`aaorb` - Enable/disable (Disable asap if any issues arises)
`aaorb color/colour/switch/switchcolor/switchcolour/change` -  toggles switchColors
